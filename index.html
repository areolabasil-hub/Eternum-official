  <h2>Chapter 1: Genesis</h2>
  <p>The throne of hell was never meant for a human—except one.<br><br>

    Betrayed by his kind.<br>
    Forgotten by the Fortuna’s.<br><br>

    He is hell-bent on revenge as his name fades from life itself.<br><br>

    He is neither human nor Fortuna.<br>
    He is something else.<br><br>

    Every fibre of his body reshaping into the divine and damned.<br><br>

    Slave. Thrall. General. Vizier.<br><br>

    Each step soaked in lies and sharpened by deceit, till he claimed the throne himself.<br><br>

    He was called the bringer of th. But no...this man was the vessel.<br><br>

    Now, he wielded the chains of eternity.<br><br>

    Hell’s fire bent to his will and even the und dared not whisper his name.<br><br>

    Glowing fire possesses his eyes, his face bathed in bitter satisfaction.<br><br>

    His voice sent chills down the spine of hell at once.<br><br>

    “It is time.”<br><br>

    Far away from scorching hell…<br>
    Beneath the sun still warm and sky still blue...<br><br>

    A boy walks home from school—unaware of the journey and darkness that lies ahead.<br><br>

    “I’m a year older—so I’m 17 now.”<br><br>

    “Ohh, yeah. I gotta go see Mom at the hospital.”<br><br>

    “I don’t think I’ve seen—”<br><br>

    WHACK<br>
    A banana smacked him in the head.<br><br>

    “I’ve been around school looking for your ass!” she says while heaving for breath and wiping the sweat from her brow.<br><br>

    Damon hands her a napkin, secretly fascinated by her beauty.<br><br>

    “Didn’t you hear me? Where you been?” she asked.<br><br>

    “Ohh I’m sorry. I was at band practice.”<br>
    He looked away.<br><br>

    “I was just thinking about you. I haven’t seen you in a while.”<br><br>

    “Yeah me too. I’ve been occupied with basketball classes.”<br><br>

    “What are you doing?” Damon asked, confused, as she dug through his bag.<br><br>

    “There it is. I’m looking for your test results. Wanna compare them to mine.”<br>
    She sat down at the nearest bench, her voice serious.<br><br>

    “You could’ve just asked,” he sighed in mock annoyance.<br><br>

    “Somehow you always seem to beat me don’t ya?”<br>
    She smirked, eyes glinting with admiration.<br><br>

    “You said you were looking for me. Why?”<br><br>

    “Ohh, right. Gotcha something. Never understood your obsession with the guy, but here you go. Happy Birthday.”<br><br>

    She hands him a piece of hard paper.<br><br>

    Surprised, he took it gently.<br><br>

    “You got me tickets...to the Monster Note Memorabilia Auction.<br><br>

    “I thought they were sold out!” he said, smiling wide.<br><br>

    She giggled. “My mom’s friends with the organiser. You’ll get to hang out with him the whole time.”<br><br>

    “Thank you, Natsuki.”<br><br>

    “I’m gonna be late, I’ve gotta go,” she said. They bid themselves goodbye.<br><br>

    Arriving home, he noticed a wrapped present on the table—his father’s gift.<br><br>

    He tore it open.<br><br>

    Inside was a ring, silver, carved with the family crest.<br><br>

    “A ring...with a Kamon?”<br><br>

    He slid it onto his middle finger.<br><br>

    Most of the day was blurred into reading, gaming, cake.<br><br>

    All celebrated alone.<br><br>

    And yet...he seemed content.<br><br>

    Clank.<br>
    The door goes behind him as he left for the hospital.<br><br>

    The streets were busy as usual, but something felt off. A chill in the air.<br><br>

    Cars hummed past. Parents called their kids into the house—warning them not to catch a cold.<br>
    Digital billboards highlighting new generator inventions and gaming wars.<br><br>

    “Why’s it cold? Even the ring’s freezing?” he says as he hides his hands in his sleeves.<br>
    “Never trust the weatherman I guess,” he says while shivering.<br><br>

    Pauses. Opening the doors to the hospital with the smell of antiseptics attacking his throat.<br>
    Glancing at the ring again—it seemed tighter on his hand and heavier.<br>
    He ignores it.<br><br>

    His mother still laying in bed, sheets pulled to her stomach.<br>
    Her breathing, shallow.<br><br>

    His mother’s body. Life depleting.<br><br>

    Holding the tears was the hardest thing he’s ever done.<br><br>

    “Mom, how are you feeling?”<br>
    His voice cracked with concern.<br><br>

    “Have you been taking your meds?”<br><br>

    Silence.<br><br>

    “You’re still not gonna talk, huh?”<br><br>

    He decides to speak for her—telling her stories of winning the online chess leagues, his grades, band practice.<br><br>

    Until finally her voice broke through.<br><br>

    “Do you...have any friends?”<br><br>

    He froze.<br><br>

    “...I have Natsuki,” he whispered.<br><br>

    “She’s not your friend.”<br>
    Her eyes—hollow, pale—cut into him.<br><br>

    “Why would anyone want to be around you?”<br><br>

    He blinked. Confused.<br><br>

    “What are you talking about...?”<br><br>

    She turned away. Tears sliding down her cheeks.<br><br>

    “I never wanted a child,” she said, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Her voice trembled.<br><br>

    “I wanted my body. Beautiful. Like it was in my youth.”<br><br>

    He stared down at his arms.<br><br>

    “You came along and ruined it. I was a model. People loved me. Now, no one even knows who I am.”<br><br>

    She sniffled.<br><br>

    “You took it all from me. I regret ever having you.”<br>
    Her hands shot out, clutching his shirt, trembling with rage.<br>
    “You were a mistake.”<br><br>

    Silence.<br><br>

    He wanted to scream but he couldn’t, like razors were at his neck.<br>
    He always thought silence meant peace. But it feels like a punishment now.<br>
    He didn’t move.<br>
    He just handed her a cup of water.<br><br>

    She slapped it away—hard.<br>
    CRASH<br>
    The glass shatters mid-air.<br>
    A shard slices into his palm.<br>
    Blood dripped, slow, steady.<br><br>

    He doesn’t cry or flinch.<br><br>

    “Why did you do that?” his voice low, broken.<br><br>

    “Get out,” his mother said.<br>
    “Get out,” she yelled.<br><br>

    Beep. Beep. Beep.<br>
    The EKG ringed.<br><br>

    “Mom...Mom”<br>
    No response.<br><br>

    BANG goes the door.<br><br>

    His footsteps echo in the hallways.<br><br>

    Speeds up. Slips.<br>
    Sees another bald patient. “Does he have cancer?” he thought, not for longer than a second.<br>
    Gets back up.<br><br>

    ‘Mistake’. ‘Regret’. ‘You took it all away from me.’<br>
    His mother’s words echo while sprinting down the hallways.<br><br>

    He reaches the doctors. Breathless. Panicked.<br>
    “My mother...HELP her!!”<br>
    The doctors rush there.<br><br>

    EKG beep. He lunges forward but the nurse blocks him.<br>
    “Stay back,” the young nurse says.<br>
    He obeys. Zero resistance.<br><br>
<p>He obeys. Zero resistance.<br><br>

   He calls his dad—no answer.<br>
 Texts him—no reply.<br><br>

He’s still replaying his mother’s words.<br>
“Why would she do that?...why would she say that?”<br>
“Did she really hide her hate for 17 years?”<br><br>

“Mr Vale. Mr Vale. Mr Vale.”<br>
The nurse repeats herself higher and higher.<br>
She taps him.<br><br>

Rushes out of his seat.<br>
“Is she alright?”<br><br>

Silence.<br>
