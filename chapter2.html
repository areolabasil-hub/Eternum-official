  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p>The nurse hesitated before speaking.<br>
  Her voice trembled like it might break if she said it too loud.<br>
  “…She’s gone.”<br>
  The words echoed through his skull — soft, but merciless.<br>
  Something inside him twisted.<br>
  Gone?<br>
  No. That wasn’t right. He just spoke to her. Just sat beside her bed.<br>
  The world tilted, but only for him.</p>

  <p>“Do you… need to call someone?” she asked, her tone careful.<br>
  He didn’t answer. Couldn’t.<br>
  Her lips were still moving, but her voice was already fading — drowned by the hum of her words in his head.<br>
  Everything sounded far away.</p>

  <p>His feet moved on their own.<br>
  Each step felt heavier. Like the world didn’t care he’d just lost someone he loved.<br>
  “Did she ever… did she ever love me?”</p>

  <p>Out the doors. Past the corridor, into the cold again.<br>
  It was like the city had no idea what just happened.<br>
  Cars honked.<br>
  Streetlights flickered.<br>
  People laughed, talked, argued.<br>
  The world moved forward.<br>
  And he was stuck.</p>

  <p>He stared at the ring. It shimmered faintly in the low light— just a glint, a flicker thin as dust.<br>
  No one else seemed to notice.<br>
  He shoved his hands into his pockets, head low, walking through a sea of strangers.<br>
  They brushed past him like wind.</p>

  <p>He crossed the road without looking.<br>
  A horn blared.<br>
  A car swerved.<br>
  “Watch where you’re going, idiot!”<br>
  He didn’t even flinch.<br>
  The driver’s voice was gone before it reached him.</p>

  <p>Home smelled like dust and silence.<br>
  He shut the door behind him — soft, deliberate.<br>
  Shoes off. Bag dropped.<br>
  No greeting. No warmth.<br>
  The gift box still sat open on the table.<br>
  He brushed past it and went to his room.<br>
  Minutes passed. Maybe hours.</p>

  <p>Then the sound of keys.<br>
  The door opened again.<br>
  His father.<br>
  “Hey… Happy birthday, kiddo,” the man said.<br>
  No reply.<br>
  “You got the ring, right?”<br>
  Silence.<br>
  “Something wrong? You look—”<br>
  “Mom’s… gone.”<br>
  “Yeah I know she went for her—”<br>
  “She’s dead.”</p>

  <p>The man froze.<br>
  For a moment, he looked like a statue.<br>
  “That’s not funny,” he said. “She’s having her surgery tod—”<br>
  “She’s dead!” Damon snapped.<br>
  The words ripped through the air like glass shattering.</p>

  <p>His father’s breath caught.<br>
  Then his knees hit the floor.<br>
  He stared blankly ahead.<br>
  Nothing came out — no words, no tears.<br>
  He stood, quietly, and walked upstairs.<br>
  The boy followed with his eyes.<br>
  The only sound left was the creak of the steps, then the bedroom door closing.</p>

  <p>That night, the house felt colder than usual.<br>
  The table downstairs still empty.<br>
  The hum of the fridge filled the silence like static.<br>
  Shatter. Thud. Slam.<br>
  He went to see the cause of these noises.<br>
  Staring through a gap in the door.<br>
  Lamp—cracked. Files everywhere, a mess—just like everything else.<br>
  His dad yelled. Crash went his mother’s vase.</p>

  <p>He showered. Brushed his teeth.<br>
  Didn’t eat. Didn’t sleep.<br>
  The next morning came and went.<br>
  His father stood by the door, tie loose, eyes hollow.<br>
  “You should go to school,” he said quietly. “It’s what she’d want.”<br>
  He almost laughed — bitterly.<br>
  She wouldn’t have wanted me at all, he thought.<br>
  But he just nodded and left.</p>

  <p>The world was busy. Again.<br>
  Wind gentle. Sky grey.<br>
  He walked with his hands in his pockets, one strap of his backpack slung lazily over his shoulder.<br>
  Uniform untucked, tie crooked.<br>
  He looked good — but empty.</p>

  <p>In class, voices blurred.<br>
  Teacher talked. Pens scratched.<br>
  He didn’t hear a word.<br>
  “Vale!” the teacher called. “Answer the question.”<br>
  He blinked. Didn’t even know what subject it was.<br>
  “Are you even listening?”<br>
  He stared at the chalkboard, then at his reflection in the window.<br>
  The ring looked normal again.<br>
  Still. Silent. Innocent.<br>
  He raised his hand.<br>
  “Can I be excused?”</p>

  <p>The bathroom mirror reflected a ghost.<br>
  Eyes red. Not tears — exhaustion.<br>
  He sat in the stall, knees pulled in, silent.<br>
  Every second stretched — like watching a pendulum clock in slow motion.</p>

  <p>After school, the corridors emptied.<br>
  He grabbed his bag, slipped outside, and sat beneath the red-leafed tree.<br>
  Natsuki found him there.<br>
  She stopped, hesitant.<br>
  “You didn’t answer my texts,” she said softly.<br>
  He didn’t move. Just sat with his elbows on his knees, staring at the pavement.<br>
  “What happened?”<br>
  He looked up at her slowly.<br>
  “She’s gone.”<br>
  Her breath hitched. “Your mom…?”<br>
  He nodded once. No tears. No break in his voice. Just… hollow.</p>

  <p>She sat beside him. Eyes wet. Hands trembling.<br>
  When she hugged him, he didn’t hug her back.<br>
  Didn’t even blink.<br>
  “I’m so sorry,” she whispered.<br>
  He waited a few seconds, then said quietly,<br>
  “I have to go home.”<br>
  “Let me walk with you,” she offered.<br>
  He shook his head.<br>
  “No need.”<br>
  The tone was flat. Empty.<br>
  The faintest hint of something darker beneath it.</p>

  <p>He opened the door to see his father at the table — tie off, arm wrapped in a bandage.<br>
  Empty bottles lined the counter.<br>
  His father looked up slowly.<br>
  “This is your fault,” he murmured.<br>
  Damon froze.<br>
  “What?”<br>
  “Fetal microchimerism,” his father said quietly.<br>
  He knew what he meant. It made it worse.<br>
  “Her body… turned against her because of you.”<br>
  The words hit harder than the blow that followed.</p>

  <p>Didn’t hit back.<br>
  Didn’t even speak. Just stared at the floor — the sting burning colder than pain.<br>
  Silence.<br>
  The room tilted again.<br>
  “YOU. KILLED. HER.” — each word, beating followed.<br>
  And then, only the shimmer — soft, blue — from the ring on his hand.</p>

  <p>He walked upstairs, face expressionless,<br>
  closed the door,<br>
  and sat in darkness.<br>
  The ring’s light pulsed faintly against the wall. Once. Twice. Then stilled.<br>
  He thought of how he hated the slap.</p>

  <p>The ring’s light flared.<br>
  Blue. White. Then—</p>

  <p>“What the fu—”</p>
