    <h2>Chapter 1: Genesis</h2>
    <p>The throne of hell was never meant for a human-except one.


Betrayed by his kind.
Forgotten by the Fortuna’s. 

He is hell-bent on revenge as his name fades from life itself. 

He is neither human nor Fortuna. 
He is something else. 

Every fibre of his body reshaping into the divine and damned. 

Slave. Thrall. General. Vizier. 

Each step soaked in lies and sharpened by deceit, till he claimed the throne himself.

He was called the bringer of th. But no...this man was ths vessel. 

Now, he wielded the chains of eternity.

Hells fire bent to his will and even the und dared not whisper his name. 

Glowing fire possesses his eyes, his face bathed in bitter satisfaction.

His voice sent chills down the spine of hell at once. 

“It is time”.
  
 
Far away from scorching hell…
Beneath the sun still warm and sky still blue...

A boy walks home from school-unaware of the journey and darkness that lies ahead.

“I’m a year older-so I’m 17 now.”

 “Ohh, yeah. I gotta go see Mom at the hospital.”

 “I don’t think I’ve seen-”

WHACK
A banana smacked him in the head. 

“I’ve been around school looking for your ass!” she says while heaving for breath and wiping the 
sweat from her brow. 

Damon hands her a napkin, secretly fascinated by her beauty.

“Didn’t you hear me? Where you been?” she asked.

“Ohh I’m sorry. I was at band practice.” 
He looked away. 

“I was just thinking about you. I haven’t seen you in a while” 

 “Yeah me too. Ive been occupied with basketball classes”. 

“What are you doing” Damon asked, confused, as she dug through his bag.

“ There its is, I’m looking for your test results. Wanna compare them to mine.” 
She sat down at the nearest bench, her voice serious. 

“You could’ve just asked” he sighed in mock annoyance 

“Somehow you always seem to beat me don’t ya?” 
She smirked, eyes glinting with admiration. 

“You said you were looking for me. Why?” 

“Ohh, right. Gotcha something. Never understood your obsession with the guy, but here you go, Happy Birthday” 

She hands him a piece of hard paper. 

Surprised, he took it gently.  

“You got me tickets...to the Monster Note Memorabilia Auction. 

“I thought they were sold out!.” he said, smiling wide.

She giggled. “My mom’s friends with the organiser. You’ll get to hang out with him the whole time.”

“Thank you, Natsuki” 

“I’m gonna be late, I’ve gotta go” she said. They bid themselves goodbye. 


Arriving home, he noticed a wrapped present on table-his father’s gift.  

He tore it open.

Inside was a ring, silver, carved with the family crest.

“A ring...with a Kamon?”

 He slid it onto his middle finger.

Most of  the day was blurred into reading, gaming, cake. 

All celebrated alone. 

And yet...he seemed content. 

Clank. 

The door goes behind him as he left for the hospital. 
The streets were busy as usual, but, something felt off. A chill in the air. 

Cars hummed past. Parents called their kids into the house-warning them not to catch a cold.
Digital billboards highlighting new generator inventions and gaming wars.

“Whys it cold​​? Even the rings freezing?” he says as he hides his hands in his sleeves.
“Never trust the weatherman I guess” he says while shivering.

Pauses. Opening the doors to the hospital with the smell of antiseptics attacking his throat.
Glancing at the ring again it seemed tighter on his hand and heavier. 
He ignores it. 

His mother still laying in bed, sheets pulled to her stomach.
Her breathing, shallow. 

His mothers body. Life depleting. 

Holding the tears was the hardest thing he’s ever done. 

“Mom, how are you feeling?” 
His voice cracked with concern.

“Have you been taking your meds”. 

Silence

“You’re still not gonna talk, huh?”

He decides to speak for her-telling her stories of winning the online chess leagues, his grades, band practice.

Until finally her voice broke through.

“ Do you...have any friends” 

He froze. 

“...I have Natsuki” he whispered. 

“She’s not your friend.”
Her eyes-hollow, pale-cut into him.

“Why would anyone want to be around you”
 
He blinked. Confused. 

“What are you talking about...?”. 

She tuned away. Tears sliding down her cheeks. 

“I never wanted a child,” she said, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Her voice trembled. 

“I wanted my body. Beautiful. Like it was in my youth.”

He stared down at his arms.

“You came along and ruined it. I was a model. People loved me. Now, no one even knows who I am.”

She sniffled.

“You took it all from me. I regret ever having you.” 
Her hands shot out, clutching his shirt trembling with rage. 
“You were a mistake.”
 Silence. 
He wanted to scream but he couldn’t, like razors where at his neck.
He always thought silence meant peace. But it feels like a punishment now. 
He didn’t move. 
He just handed her a cup of water.
She slapped it away—hard. 
CRASH
The glass shatters mid-air. 
A shard slices into his palm. 
Blood dripped, slow, steady.
He doesn’t cry or flinch. 
“Why did you do that” his voice low, broken. 
“Get out” his mother said.
“Get out” she yelled. 
Beep. Beep. Beep.
The EKG ringed. 

“Mom..Mom” 
No response 
 
BANG goes the door

His footsteps echo in the hallways 

Speeds up. Slips.
Sees another bald patient. “does he have cancer​?” he thought, not for longer than a second. 
Gets back up. 
‘Mistake’. ‘Regret’. ‘You took it all away from me.’ 
His mothers words echo while sprinting down the hallways.  

He reaches the doctors. Breathless. Panicked. 
“My mother...HELP her!!” the doctors rush there. 

EKG beep. He lunges forward but the nurse block him.
“Stay back” the young nurse says. 
He obeys. 0 resistance. 
 
He calls his dad-no answer. Texts him-no reply. 
He’s still replaying his mothers words. 
“Why would she do that?...why would she says that?” 
“Did she really hide her hate for 17 years”

“Mr Vale. Mr Vale. Mr Vale.”  the nurse repeats herself higher and higher. She taps him.

Rushes of his seat.
“Is she alright?”

Silence.
