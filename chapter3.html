<p>“What the fu—”</p>
<p>The ring pulsed again.</p>
<p>His voice barely left his throat — panic choking what words remained.</p>
<p>Cold one second, hot the next. The hum grew louder. Steady. Alive.</p>
<p>Damon stumbled back, eyes wide, breath sharp. He yanked at it — twisting, pulling, shaking his hand like force alone could free him.</p>
<p>It slipped loose.</p>
<p>The ring spun through the air, clinking across the table, rolling toward the open window.</p>
<p>He lunged.</p>
<p>His breath caught as it teetered on the edge, his body halfway outside. The night wind cut against his face, cold and sharp.</p>
<p>He caught it — just in time.</p>
<p>He didn’t move. Just stared at the drop below.</p>
<p>“I’d be dead if I fell… just like you always wanted,” he muttered.</p>
<p>It didn’t feel cold.</p>
<p>Didn’t feel magical.</p>
<p>Just… normal.</p>
<p>He slid it back on, breathing slow. The faint shimmer that had lit his room moments ago — gone.</p>
<p>Darkness again.</p>

<br>

<p>Morning came too fast.</p>
<p>Traffic murmured outside his window. His father’s door — still shut.</p>
<p>He brushed his teeth, threw on his black Southmere High uniform — tie loose, shirt untucked.</p>
<p>He looked fine. Almost cool.</p>
<p>But the mirror didn’t lie. The ring glinted faintly.</p>
<p>Breakfast sat untouched. Hunger left days ago.</p>
<p>He walked to school with one strap of his bag slung over his shoulder, hands buried in pockets.</p>

<br>

<p>The club meeting dragged.</p>
<p>By afternoon, he was in the gym helping Natsuki practice.</p>
<p>“Fourteen threes in thirty minutes. New record,” he said, a faint smile tugging at his lips.</p>
<p>Silence. She drank water.</p>
<p>“How’s your dad doing?” she asked softly.</p>
<p>“He’s drunk.”</p>
<p>He bent to grab his bag.</p>
<p>She caught sight of the scars.</p>
<p>“Has he been hitting you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… but I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“You’re not fine.” Her tone sharpened. “You’ve been dull in class, eating lunch alone on the roof. I’m trying to help you.”</p>
<p>“I said I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed. “No. You don’t get to give me attitude. It’s been three months since the funeral, Damon. I’ve been there — even while losing someone too.”</p>
<p>Tears welled up.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” he asked quietly.</p>
<p>“My dad has Alzheimer’s,” she said. “You’d have known if you’d been there… I’m your best friend.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki, I’m so—”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother.” She swung her bag over her shoulder. “You’d rather bury it than talk about it.”</p>
<p>She walked off.</p>
<p>He didn’t follow — just stared at the floor, guilt pressing heavy on his chest.</p>

<br>

<p>By evening, he reached the Monster Note Memorabilia Auction early.</p>
<p>(He still thought that name was dumb.)</p>
<p>Rows of chairs. A makeshift stage. Old posters on faded walls.</p>
<p>A man in his thirties — clean suit, slick hair — walked up.</p>
<p>“You’re the one Natsuki’s mom talked about?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Appreciate the help. Mind holding that ladder steady?”</p>
<p>Damon nodded. They worked in quiet rhythm — moving boxes, fixing cables.</p>

<br>

<p>Then—</p>
<p><strong>Crash.</strong></p>
<p>The top speaker broke loose, falling toward one of the helpers.</p>
<p>“Hey! HEY! Mr. Seijuru!”</p>
<p>He didn’t think — he moved.</p>
<p>Feet pounding. Weaving through crates and cables. The world blurred at the edges.</p>
<p>He reached just in time, shoulder slamming the stand, both hands catching the falling speaker.</p>
<p>His knees buckled — but he held.</p>
<p>The man blinked, stunned.</p>
<p>“Woah, kid, you just saved my life. How’d you get here so fast?”</p>
<p>“I was… nearby.”</p>
<p>The man chuckled. “You look skinny but strong. Ever thought of joining the track team?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you ever need something, come find me.”</p>

<br>

<p>The event went on — lights, voices, bidding — but Damon couldn’t stop replaying it.</p>
<p>That speed. That strength.</p>
<p>It didn’t feel human.</p>

<br>

<p>When it finally ended, the moon was high.</p>
<p>He looked up.</p>
<p>“Mom loves the moon,” he whispered.</p>
<p>He raised his phone for a photo.</p>
<p>Then froze.</p>
<p>She wasn’t there anymore.</p>

<br>

<p>He took the long way home, hands deep in his pockets.</p>
<p>Halfway there, he cut through an alley — shortcut.</p>
<p>Bad idea.</p>

<br>

<p>Three guys. Drunk. Loud.</p>
<p>“Yo, pretty boy,” one slurred. “Thought you could skip out on us, huh?”</p>
<p>“Wrong guy,” Damon said, trying to pass.</p>
<p>One grabbed his collar.</p>
<p>Fists followed — gut, face, ribs.</p>
<p>Laughter echoed off concrete.</p>

<br>

<p>Pain. Noise. Then— silence.</p>
<p>The ringing in his ears wasn’t from the hits. It was from the ring.</p>
<p>It glowed again — brighter, pulsing in sync with his heartbeat. The men didn’t even see it.</p>

<br>

<p>Then—</p>
<p><strong>BOOM.</strong></p>
<p>A flash. One screamed, clutching his eye from the exploded ring shards.</p>
<p>“You bastard!” another yelled, swinging a bottle.</p>
<p>But Damon was already moving — left, right — faster than thought.</p>
<p>Every dodge left a faint afterimage, like a glitch in time.</p>
<p>He didn’t understand it.</p>
<p>But he liked it.</p>

<br>

<p>He struck back.</p>
<p>A punch — thunder.</p>
<p>Another — steel.</p>
<p>Each hit sharper, faster, heavier — power roaring through his veins.</p>
<p>One man hit the wall.</p>
<p>Another crashed through crates.</p>
<p>The last tumbled into a dumpster.</p>

<br>

<p>Silence again.</p>
<p>Damon stood there, panting. His hands trembled, but his chest burned — alive.</p>
<p>He looked at the shimmer fading from his hand.</p>
<p>“…What the hell is happening to me?”</p>

<br>

<p>Then he heard it.</p>
<p>Engines. Laughter. Boots scraping asphalt.</p>
<p>Dozens of shadows in the distance.</p>
<p>He cracked his knuckles, eyes cold.</p>
<p>“Alright…” he muttered, stepping forward.</p>
<p>“…let’s end this.”</p>
