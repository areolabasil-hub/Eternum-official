        <h3>Chapter 1 — Genesis</h3>
        <p id="chapterText">
          The throne of hell was never meant for a human—except one.<br><br>
          Betrayed by his kind. Forgotten by the Fortuna’s...<br><br>
     

He is hell-bent on revenge as his name fades from life itself.<br><br> 

He is neither human nor Fortuna.<br> 
He is something else.<br><br> 

Every fibre of his body reshaping into the divine and damned. <br><br>

Slave. Thrall. General. Vizier. <br><br>

Each step soaked in lies and sharpened by deceit, till he claimed the throne himself.<br><br>

He was called the bringer of death. But no...this man was deaths vessel. <br><br>

Now, he wielded the chains of eternity.<br><br>

Hells fire bent to his will and even the und dared not whisper his name.<br><br> 

Glowing fire possesses his eyes, his face bathed in bitter satisfaction.<br><br>

His voice sent chills down the spine of hell at once.<br><br>

“It is time”.<br><br>
  <hr>
 
Far away from scorching hell…<br>
Beneath the sun still warm and sky still blue...<br><br>

A boy walks home from school-unaware of the journey and darkness that lies ahead. <br><br>

“I’m a year older-so I’m 17 now.”<br><br>

 “Ohh, yeah. I gotta go see Mom at the hospital.”<br><br>

 “I don’t think I’ve seen-”<br><br>

WHACK<br>
A banana smacked him in the head. <br><br>

“I’ve been around school looking for your ass!” she says while heaving for breath and wiping the 
sweat from her brow. <br><br>

Damon hands her a napkin, secretly fascinated by her beauty.<br><br>

“Didn’t you hear me? Where you been?” she asked.<br><br>

“Ohh I’m sorry. I was at band practice.” <br>
He looked away. <br><br>

“I was just thinking about you. I haven’t seen you in a while” <br><br>

 “Yeah me too. Ive been occupied with basketball classes”. <br><br>

“What are you doing” Damon asked, confused, as she dug through his bag.<br><br>

“ There its is, I’m looking for your test results. Wanna compare them to mine.” <br>
She sat down at the nearest bench, her voice serious. <br><br>

“You could’ve just asked” he sighed in mock annoyance <br><br>

“Somehow you always seem to beat me don’t ya?” <br>
She smirked, eyes glinting with admiration. <br><br>

“You said you were looking for me. Why?” <br><br>

“Ohh, right. Gotcha something. Never understood your obsession with the guy, but here you go, Happy Birthday” <br><br>

She hands him a piece of hard paper. <br><br>

Surprised, he took it gently.  <br><br>

“You got me tickets...to the Monster Note Memorabilia Auction. <br><br>

“I thought they were sold out!.” he said, smiling wide.<br><br>

She giggled. “My mom’s friends with the organiser. You’ll get to hang out with him the whole time.”<br><br>

“Thank you, Natsuki” <br><br>

“I’m gonna be late, I’ve gotta go” she said. They bid themselves goodbye. <br><br>

<hr>
Arriving home, he noticed a wrapped present on table-his father’s gift.  <br><br>

He tore it open.<br><br>

Inside was a ring, silver, carved with the family crest.<br><br>

“A ring...with a Kamon?”<br><br>

 He slid it onto his middle finger.<br><br>

Most of  the day was blurred into reading, gaming, cake. <br><br>

All celebrated alone. <br><br>

And yet...he seemed content. <br><br>

Clank. <br><br>

The door goes behind him as he left for the hospital. <br>
The streets were busy as usual, but, something felt off. A chill in the air. <br><br>

Cars hummed past. Parents called their kids into the house-warning them not to catch a cold.<br>
Digital billboards highlighting new generator inventions and gaming wars.<br><br>

“Whys it cold​​? Even the rings freezing?” he says as he hides his hands in his sleeves.<br>
“Never trust the weatherman I guess” he says while shivering.<br><br>

Pauses. Opening the doors to the hospital with the smell of antiseptics attacking his throat.<br>
Glancing at the ring again it seemed tighter on his hand and heavier. <br>
He ignores it. <br><br>

His mother still laying in bed, sheets pulled to her stomach.<br>
Her breathing, shallow. <br><br>

His mothers body. Life depleting.<br><br>

Holding the tears was the hardest thing he’s ever done. <br><br>

“Mom, how are you feeling?” <br>
His voice cracked with concern.<br><br>

“Have you been taking your meds”. <br><br>

Silence<br><br>

“You’re still not gonna talk, huh?”<br><br>

He decides to speak for her-telling her stories of winning the online chess leagues, his grades, band practice.<br><br>

Until finally her voice broke through.<br><br>

“ Do you...have any friends” <br><br>

He froze. <br><br>

“...I have Natsuki” he whispered. <br><br>

“She’s not your friend.”<br><br>
Her eyes-hollow, pale-cut into him.<br><br>

“Why would anyone want to be around you”<br><br>
 
He blinked. Confused. <br><br>

“What are you talking about...?”. <br><br>

She tuned away. Tears sliding down her cheeks. <br><br>

“I never wanted a child,” she said, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Her voice trembled. <br><br>

“I wanted my body. Beautiful. Like it was in my youth.”<br><br>

He stared down at his arms.<br><br>

“You came along and ruined it. I was a model. People loved me. Now, no one even knows who I am.”<br><br>

She sniffled.<br><br>

“You took it all from me. I regret ever having you.” <br>
Her hands shot out, clutching his shirt trembling with rage. <br>
“You were a mistake.”<br>
 Silence. <br><br>
He wanted to scream but he couldn’t, like razors where at his neck.<br>
He always thought silence meant peace. But it feels like a punishment now. <br>
He didn’t move. <br>
He just handed her a cup of water.<br>
She slapped it away—hard. <br><br>
CRASH<br><br>
The glass shatters mid-air. <br>
A shard slices into his palm.<br> 
Blood dripped, slow, steady.<br>
He doesn’t cry or flinch. <br><br>
“Why did you do that” his voice low, broken. <br>
“Get out” his mother said.<br>
“Get out” she yelled. <br>
Beep. Beep. Beep.<br>
The EKG ringed. <br><br>

“Mom..Mom” <br>
No response <br><br>
 
BANG goes the door<br><br>

His footsteps echo in the hallways <br><br>

Speeds up. Slips.<br>
Sees another bald patient. “does he have cancer​?” he thought, not for longer than a second. <br>
Gets back up. <br>
‘Mistake’. ‘Regret’. ‘You took it all away from me.’ <br>
His mothers words echo while sprinting down the hallways.  <br><br>

He reaches the doctors. Breathless. Panicked. <br>
“My mother...HELP her!!” the doctors rush there.<br><br> 

EKG beep. He lunges forward but the nurse block him.<br>
“Stay back” the young nurse says. <br>
He obeys. 0 resistance. <br><br>
 
He calls his dad-no answer. Texts him-no reply. <br>
He’s still replaying his mothers words. <br>
“Why would she do that?...why would she says that?” <br>
“Did she really hide her hate for 17 years”<br><br>

“Mr Vale. Mr Vale. Mr Vale.”  the nurse repeats herself higher and higher. She taps him.<br><br>

Rushes of his seat.<br><br>
“Is she alright?”<br>

Silence.
