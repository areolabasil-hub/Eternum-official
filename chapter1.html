    <div class="chapter-text">


<p>The throne of hell was never meant for a human—except one.</p>
<br>
<p>Betrayed by his kind.<br>Forgotten by the Fortuna’s.</p>
<br>
<p>He is hell-bent on revenge as his name fades from life itself.</p>
<br>
<p>He is neither human nor Fortuna.<br>He is something else.</p>
<br>
<p>Every fibre of his body reshaping into the divine and damned.</p>
<br>
<p>Slave. Thrall. General. Vizier.</p>
<br>
<p>Each step soaked in lies and sharpened by deceit, till he claimed the throne himself.</p>
<br>
<p>He was called the bringer of death. But no... this man was death’s vessel.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, he wielded the chains of eternity.</p>
<br>
<p>Hell’s fire bent to his will and even the undead dared not whisper his name.</p>
<br>
<p>Glowing fire possesses his eyes, his face bathed in bitter satisfaction.</p>
<p>His voice sent chills down the spine of hell at once.</p>
<br>
<p>“It is time.”</p>
<br><br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Far away from scorching hell…<br>Beneath the sun still warm and sky still blue...</p>
<br>
<p>A boy walks home from school—unaware of the journey and darkness that lies ahead.</p>
<br>
<p>“I’m a year older—so I’m 17 now.”</p>
<p>“Ohh, yeah. I gotta go see Mom at the hospital.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve seen—”</p>
<br>
<p><strong>WHACK</strong><br>A banana smacked him in the head.</p>
<br>
<p>“I’ve been around school looking for your ass!” she says while heaving for breath and wiping the sweat from her brow.</p>
<p>Damon hands her a napkin, secretly fascinated by her beauty.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear me? Where you been?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Ohh I’m sorry. I was at band practice.”<br>He looked away.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking about you. I haven’t seen you in a while.”</p>
<p>“Yeah me too. I’ve been occupied with basketball classes.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Damon asked, confused, as she dug through his bag.</p>
<p>“There it is. I’m looking for your test results. Wanna compare them to mine.”<br>She sat down at the nearest bench, her voice serious.</p>
<p>“You could’ve just asked,” he sighed in mock annoyance.</p>
<p>“Somehow you always seem to beat me don’t ya?”<br>She smirked, eyes glinting with admiration.</p>
<p>“You said you were looking for me. Why?”</p>
<p>“Ohh, right. Gotcha something. Never understood your obsession with the guy, but here you go. Happy Birthday.”</p>
<p>She hands him a piece of hard paper.</p>
<p>Surprised, he took it gently.</p>
<p>“You got me tickets... to the Monster Note Memorabilia Auction.”</p>
<p>“I thought they were sold out!” he said, smiling wide.</p>
<p>She giggled. “My mom’s friends with the organiser. You’ll get to hang out with him the whole time.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna be late, I’ve gotta go,” she said. They bid themselves goodbye.</p>
<br><br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Arriving home, he noticed a wrapped present on the table—his father’s gift.</p>
<p>He tore it open.</p>
<p>Inside was a ring, silver, carved with the family crest.</p>
<p>“A ring... with a Kamon?”</p>
<p>He slid it onto his middle finger.</p>
<br>
<p>Most of the day was blurred into reading, gaming, cake.</p>
<p>All celebrated alone.</p>
<p>And yet... he seemed content.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Clank.</strong><br>The door goes behind him as he left for the hospital.</p>
<p>The streets were busy as usual, but something felt off. A chill in the air.</p>
<p>Cars hummed past. Parents called their kids into the house—warning them not to catch a cold.</p>
<p>Digital billboards highlighting new generator inventions and gaming wars.</p>
<p>“Why’s it cold? Even the ring’s freezing?” he says as he hides his hands in his sleeves.</p>
<p>“Never trust the weatherman I guess,” he says while shivering.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Pauses. Opening the doors to the hospital with the smell of antiseptics attacking his throat.</p>
<p>Glancing at the ring again—it seemed tighter on his hand and heavier.</p>
<p>He ignores it.</p>
<br>
<p>His mother still laying in bed, sheets pulled to her stomach.</p>
<p>Her breathing, shallow.</p>
<p>His mother’s body. Life depleting.</p>
<p>Holding the tears was the hardest thing he’s ever done.</p>
<br>
<p>“Mom, how are you feeling?”<br>His voice cracked with concern.</p>
<p>“Have you been taking your meds?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“You’re still not gonna talk, huh?”</p>
<br>
<p>He decides to speak for her—telling her stories of winning the online chess leagues, his grades, band practice.</p>
<p>Until finally her voice broke through.</p>
<p>“Do you... have any friends?”</p>
<p>He froze.</p>
<p>“...I have Natsuki,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“She’s not your friend.”<br>Her eyes—hollow, pale—cut into him.</p>
<p>“Why would anyone want to be around you?”</p>
<p>He blinked. Confused.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about...?”</p>
<p>She turned away. Tears sliding down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“I never wanted a child,” she said, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Her voice trembled.</p>
<p>“I wanted my body. Beautiful. Like it was in my youth.”</p>
<p>He stared down at his arms.</p>
<p>“You came along and ruined it. I was a model. People loved me. Now, no one even knows who I am.”</p>
<p>She sniffled.</p>
<p>“You took it all from me. I regret ever having you.”</p>
<p>Her hands shot out, clutching his shirt trembling with rage.</p>
<p>“You were a mistake.”</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>He wanted to scream but he couldn’t, like razors were at his neck.</p>
<p>He always thought silence meant peace. But it feels like a punishment now.</p>
<p>He didn’t move.</p>
<p>He just handed her a cup of water.</p>
<p>She slapped it away—hard.</p>
<p><strong>CRASH</strong><br>The glass shatters mid-air.</p>
<p>A shard slices into his palm.</p>
<p>Blood dripped, slow, steady.</p>
<p>He doesn’t cry or flinch.</p>
<p>“Why did you do that?” his voice low, broken.</p>
<p>“Get out,” his mother said.</p>
<p>“Get out!” she yelled.</p>
<p><strong>Beep. Beep. Beep.</strong><br>The EKG ringed.</p>
<br>
<p>“Mom... Mom.”<br>No response.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>BANG</strong> goes the door.</p>
<p>His footsteps echo in the hallways.</p>
<p>Speeds up. Slips.</p>
<p>Sees another bald patient. “Does he have cancer?” he thought, not for longer than a second.</p>
<p>Gets back up.</p>
<p>‘Mistake.’ ‘Regret.’ ‘You took it all away from me.’</p>
<p>His mother’s words echo while sprinting down the hallways.</p>
<br>
<p>He reaches the doctors. Breathless. Panicked.</p>
<p>“My mother... HELP her!!”<br>The doctors rush there.</p>
<p>EKG beep. He lunges forward but the nurse blocks him.</p>
<p>“Stay back,” the young nurse says.</p>
<p>He obeys. Zero resistance.</p>
<br>
<p>He calls his dad—no answer. Texts him—no reply.</p>
<p>He’s still replaying his mother’s words.</p>
<p>“Why would she do that?... Why would she say that?”</p>
<p>“Did she really hide her hate for 17 years</p>
<hr>
“Mr Vale. Mr Vale. Mr Vale.”  the nurse repeats herself higher and higher. She taps him.

Rushes of his seat.
“Is she alright?”

Silence.
